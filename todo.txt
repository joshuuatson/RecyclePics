Planned next steps:

1. Need a dummy classifier, and utilities working
- e.g. get classify_bin() working
2. Add image and loading sequence
- load_image(image_path) should return some Torch tensor
3. Try to use the YOLOv8 model and wrap in model/predict.py
4. Integrate into main.py
5. Remember to write tests as we go
